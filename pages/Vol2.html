    Volume 2: Commands</h2>
<h3>Setting up a command</h3>
Using commands in a plugin enchants your Plugin! Commands can automatically and easily do things for you!
<blockquote>Insert these "use" statements if you are using commands:</blockquote>
<pre><code>// Command
use pocketmine\command\Command;

// Person who does command
use pocketmine\command\CommandSender;</code></pre>
<blockquote>To setup the command we use a public function! Layout:</blockquote>
<pre><code>public function onCommand(CommandSender $sender,Command $cmd,string $label,array $args) : bool{
}</code></pre> It may be long for a function, but thats how you're gonna make commands!
<blockquote>After Public Function onCommand():</blockquote>

<pre><code>if($cmd->getName() == "test"){ //In this case, we will make the command "/test"
     $sender->sendMessage("This is a Test");</code></pre> Explanation: In the scenario above, if the command "/test" is issued, the server will send a message to the player who executed this Command! Congratulations on your first "if" statement! These
are very important in PHP!<br>
<BR>
<blockquote>PREVIEW: Lets see what we got so far...</blockquote>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

namespace Inactive-to-Reactive;

use pocketmine\plugin\PluginBase;
use pocketmine\event\Listener;
use pocketmine\event\player\PlayerJoinEvent;
use pocketmine\utils\TextFormat;
use pocketmine\command\Command;
use pocketmine\command\CommandSender;

class Inactive-to-ReactiveExample extends PluginBase implements Listener{
     public function onEnable(){
          $this->getServer()->getPluginManager()->registerEvents($this,$this);
          $this->getLogger()->info("Plugin Enabled");
     }
     public function onJoin(PlayerJoinEvent $event){
          $player = $event->getPlayer();
          $name = $player->getName();
          $this->getServer()->broadcastMessage(TextFormat::GREEN."$name Joined The Inactive-to-Reactive test Server! Awesome!");
     }
     public function onCommand(CommandSender $sender, Command $cmd, string $label, array $args) : bool{
          if($cmd->getName() == "test"){
               $sender->sendMessage("This Is A Test!");
          }
          return true;
     }
}</code></pre> The "return true" statement goes AFTER the if brackets "{" and "}" So when some one does /test they get a message "This is a test!" <br> Is this too boring for you? Wanna make it EVEN BETTER?

<blockquote>This is how you can make the command "/test" a LOT better! Now, when the player issues a command, he/she will recieve 4 steak!</blockquote>
<pre><code>if($cmd->getName() == "test"){
     $sender->getInventory()->addItem(Item::get(364,0,4)); //364 = Item ID Value (in this case, 364 is steak)
     $sender->sendMessage(TextFormat::BOLD."You have just recieved 4 steak!");
}
return true;</code></pre> This command lets you get four steaks! This shows you almost how powerful commands can be, but there is a LOT more! Unfortunately, something is not right! What would happen if the CONSOLE was the command sender? How do we prevent
the Console?
<br><br>
<blockquote>To prevent the situation above we are going to use an if statement including "instanceof" </blockquote>

<pre><code>if($cmd->getName() == "test"){
     if(!$sender instanceof Player){ // Basically this checks if the Command Sender is NOT a player
          $sender->sendMessage("This Command Only Works for players! Please perform this command IN GAME!"); // For Console Command Sender
     }else{ //if command sender is not a CONSOLE
          $sender->getInventory()->addItem(Item::get(364,0,4));
          $sender->sendMessage("You have just recieved 4 steak!");
     }
}
return true;</code></pre> 
    <br>This handy dandy chunk of code will make sure that your server does not crash when it tries to give the console 4 steak (which it can no longer do).
    <h3>Wanna know EVEN more? Arguments.</h3>
    Great ! Now that we know how to do "basic" commands, let's make the command <i>even better</i> by allowing the user to choose how many steaks he wants !<br>
    We'll take a look at a variable that we added without knowing what it was... I talk about the <code>$args</code> variable!<br>
    It basicly stores every single arguments you use in an array.<br>
    But how is it stored? Like this: <pre><code>/command &lt;$args[0]&gt; &lt;$args[1]&gt; &lt;$args[2]&gt; &lt;$args[3]&gt; ...</code></pre>
    Warning: Arrays always starts from 0 !<br>
    Let's apply this to our code:<br>
    
    <pre><code>if($cmd->getName() == "test"){
     if(!$sender instanceof Player){
          $sender->sendMessage("This Command Only Works for players! Please perform this command IN GAME!");
     }else{
          $sender->getInventory()->addItem(Item::get(364,0,$args[0])); // We choose the first argument as the count !
          $sender->sendMessage("You have just recieved". count($args[0]) . " steak!");
     }
}
return true;</code></pre> 
    As you can see, now we can use the /test &lt;steaks number&gt; and it will give us the number of steaks we want!<br>
    But wait, what if the user doesn't enter the argument? The command won't work !<br>
    To solve that issue, we need to add a parser to check if no argument "0" was entered, and if that's the case, "creating" it.<br>
    We'll use function <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.isset.php"><code>isset</code></a> which allows us to check if a variable is defined.<br>
    Let's what this give use in our code !<br>
    
    <pre><code>if($cmd->getName() == "test"){
     if(!$sender instanceof Player){
          $sender->sendMessage("This Command Only Works for players! Please perform this command IN GAME!");
     }else{
          if(!isset($args[0])) { // Check if argument 0 isn't defined.
                $args[0] = 4; // Defining $args[0] with value 4
          }
          $sender->getInventory()->addItem(Item::get(364,0,$args[0]));
          $sender->sendMessage("You have just recieved" .count($args[0]). " steak!");
     }
}
return true;</code></pre> 
    Seems already better !<br>
    But what if the user don't enter a number? And even if it's a number, what if it's negative?<br>
    We also need to check this in our code! We will use a new function <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.is-int.php"><code>is_int</code></a> which will allow us to check if a variable is an integer.<br>
    
    <pre><code>if($cmd->getName() == "test"){
     if(!$sender instanceof Player){
          $sender->sendMessage("This Command Only Works for players! Please perform this command IN GAME!");
     }else{
          if(!isset($args[0]) or (is_int($args[0]) and $args[0] > 0)) { // Check if argument 0 is an integer and is more than 0.
                $args[0] = 4; // Defining $args[0] with value 4
          }
          $sender->getInventory()->addItem(Item::get(364,0,$args[0]));
          $sender->sendMessage("You have just recieved" .count($args[0]). " steak!");
     }
}
return true;</code></pre> 
    And that's it ! You made your first command with arguments !
