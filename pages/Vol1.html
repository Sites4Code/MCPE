    Volume 1: Basics and Concepts</h2>
<p>In this first Volume, you will learn all of the items of code that are required in order for the plugin to work. You will also find the most basic functions that are optional, but they add a nice finishing (or starting, in this case) touch to the plugin!</p>
<h3>First Steps</h3>
<pre><code>&lt;?php//All PHP Files must start with this.

namespace Inactive-to-Reactive; //This should be the subfolder of the src directory. Based off of the folder structure example in the "intro" section, this is Inactive-to-Reactive

#next, we add the "use" statements. Note, more use statements will be added as we progress through the lessons
use pocketmine\plugin\PluginBase;

#Then, we type the class statement:
class Inactive-to-ReactiveExample extends PluginBase{ //This has a specific format: class (The File Name) extends PluginBase{ The "PluginBase" part differs based on which file it is, but that is very advanced. You will find out more another time.
								</code></pre>
<h3>Enable, Disable, and Load functions!</h3>
After the class statement press ENTER key and type
<pre><code>public function onLoad(){</code></pre>
<blockquote>If you want a Load Message!</blockquote>
Press ENTER after the function line and type:
<pre><code>$this->getLogger()->info("Plugin Loading");</code></pre> You just created a public function and created a load message!

<blockquote>Here is the layout so far, and I hope common sense allows you to understand onEnable and onDisable even though we didn't give you a step by step for them:</blockquote>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

namespace Inactive-to-Reactive;

use pocketmine\plugin\PluginBase;

class Inactive-to-ReactiveExample extends PluginBase{

          public function onLoad(){
                    $this->getLogger()->info("Plugin Loading");
          }
          public function onEnable(){
                    $this->getLogger()->info("Enabled Plugin");
          }
          public function onDisable(){
                    $this->getLogger()->info("Plugin Disabled");
          }
}</code></pre> Public function onEnable is when your plugin Enables on the Logger or as we all know the CONSOLE. The plugin sends a message to the console on Enable!
<br><br> Public function on Disable is when your plugin disables on the Logger or as we also know the CONSOLE. The plugin sends a message to the console on Disable!
<br><br> You have learned the 3 BASIC Functions! Congratulations! <br><br><br>
<h3>Player Events!</h3>
You know the basics! SO what now? Now we are going to learn about something that makes plugins how they are! Player Events\Events...In this lesson we will be focusing on PlayerJoinEvent and PlayerQuitEvent - Two Major Events!

<blockquote>To apply this in your plugin import these USE Statements! Remember "use" statements? import the following:</blockquote>
<pre><code>// Event when Player Joins
use pocketmine\event\player\PlayerJoinEvent;

// Event When Player Quits
use pocketmine\event\player\PlayerQuitEvent;

// Player "class"
use pocketmine\Player;

// Server "class"
use pocketmine\Server;

// Event Listener
use pocketmine\event\Listener;</code></pre>

<blockquote>Since we are using events now, we change the class statement a bit:</blockquote>
<pre><code>class Inactive-to-ReactiveExample extends PluginBase implements Listener{</code></pre>

<blockquote>For the onEnable() function we add this line right after public function onEnable() (Since we are USING EVENTS!!!)</blockquote>
<pre><code>public function onEnable(){
     $this->getServer()->getPluginManager()->registerEvents($this,$this); // THIS LINE
     $this->getLogger()->info("Plugin Enabled");</code></pre>

<blockquote>Do you want to broadcast a message on the server saying someone joined in a FANCY way? Then we are going to use another function!!! Here:</blockquote>
<pre><code>public function onJoin(PlayerJoinEvent $event){
   $player = $event->getPlayer();
   $name = $player->getName();
   $this->getServer()->broadcastMessage("$name Joined The Inactive-to-Reactive test Server! Awesome!");
   </code></pre> Did you know: getPlayer() and getName() are public functions? This is how NEW Functions are made! "onJoin" is a new public function! People who know JavaScript may know this!

<blockquote>Congratulations on getting a Join message, but do you want it in COLOR? Import this "use" statement to your code:</blockquote>
<pre><code>// Text Format formats text and changes Color

use pocketmine\utils\TextFormat;</code></pre>

<blockquote>Now for your message:</blockquote>
<pre><code>$this->getServer()->broadcastMessage(TextFormat::GREEN."$name Joined The Inactive-to-Reactive test Server! Awesome!");</code></pre> Now the Color of your message will be Green! NOTE: Instead of using getPlayer() in PlayerDeathEvent, make sure
you use getEntity() or it will crash your server for everytime someone dies. A LIST of PLAYER events could be found here: <a href="https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/tree/master/src/pocketmine/event/player">ClickMeBro</a>
