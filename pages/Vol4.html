         <h3>Creating a simple plugin task</h3>
         We'll take our last plugin and adding a simple task to it that tells the user when 10 seconds has past.<br>
         First, go to your "Inactive-to-ReactiveExample.php" folder and create a new folder called "tasks".<br>
         Create a new file called "MyTask.php".<br>
         And put those contents inside of it.<br>
         <pre><code>
             &lt?php // As always when you start a PHP file

             namespace Inactive-to-Reactive\tasks; // Use the same namespace as in your first file but add a \tasks who symbolise that this file is in the subfolder "tasks"

             use pocketmine\scheduler\PluginTask; // This is the class that your task will extends to be a plugin task
             use Inactive-to-Reactive\Inactive-to-ReactiveExample; // This will allow us to use our main class. It is a required argument for a plugin task.
             
             class MyTask extends PluginTask { // Remember that your task must have the same name as your file !

                // First we need a __construct function which is used when you create a class to set default variables, ect...
                public function __construct(Inactive-to-ReactiveExample $main, string $playername) { // The arguments you define here depends on what do you want to do exept for your base.
                    parent::__construct($main); // Used to meet pocketmine requirements for the tasks. You can retrieve your main class at anytime and use it's methods on your class by using $this->getOwner()
                    $this->playername = $playername; // So we can retreive the player for later.
                }


                // Then we'll create an onRun funtion wich will be called when the time has past to the execution of the task
                public function onRun($tick) { // $tick is the current server tick when the task executes
                    $player = $this->getOwner()->getServer()->getPlayer($this->playername()); // This retreive the main class with $this->getOwner() then asks the server for the player with the name $this->playername
                    if($player instanceof Player) { // Basicly checks if the player we retreive is online.
                        $player->sendMessage("10 seconds has past!"); // Sends him a message !
                    }
                }
             }.
             </code></pre>
             That's it you created a task ! Now we'll see how to execute it.<br>
             First we will make it execute 1 time, but delayed<br>
             In your main class, where you did your "test" command.
             <pre><code>
                 $task = new tasks\MyTask($this, $sender->getName()); // Create the new class Task by calling
                 $this->getServer()->getScheduler()->scheduleDelayedTask($task, 10*20); // Counted in ticks (1 second = 20 ticks)
                 </code></pre>
                 So the player will receive a message 10 seconds after he executed the command /test !<br>
                 But now, what if we want the player to receive a message <b>each</b> 10 seconds?<br>
                 Well, there's a special function for that ! We don't even need to change the task !<br>
             <pre><code>
                 $task = new tasks\MyTask($this, $sender->getName()); // Create the new class Task by calling
                 $this->getServer()->getScheduler()->scheduleRepeatingTask($task, 10*20); // Counted in ticks (1 second = 20 ticks)
                 </code></pre>
