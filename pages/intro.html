    Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the new and redesigned "Learn How To Code" website! Our goal is to teach you how to code plugins for PocketMine-MP and other spoons, so that you can contribute to the large community by submitting your own plugins/addons!</p>
<p>Credits go to @TheKnightGamer for publicizing and sharing the website, to @remote_vase for creating the website and adding a little to the tutorials, and to @Taki21 for creating the tutorials and posting them on ImagicalMine Community forums.
